summary: Collection of USB tools to query connected USB devices
description: |
  This is a collection of USB tools for use on Linux and BSD systems to query what type of USB devices are connected to the system. This is to be run on a USB host (i.e. a machine you plug USB devices into), not on a USB device (i.e. a device you plug into a USB host).
